"there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .", P
"after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !",n
"i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .",p
"my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .",p
"the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .",p
"the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .",p
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .,p
"after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .",n
"here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .",p
"it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !",p
"i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .",n
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !,p
"the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .",p
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .,n
"the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --",n
"the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .",n
"the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .",n
the volume .,n
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .,n
"on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .",p
"i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .",p
"i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .",n
"also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .",n
"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .",n
"i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .",n
"apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .",n
"in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .",p
"t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .",p
"however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .",p
"i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .",p
"while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .",p
 highly recommend a nokia 6610 .,p
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .,p
"from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .",p
"whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .",p
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .,p
he volume level of the phone is not all that good .,n
"some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .",n
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .,n
the vibration is not top .,n
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .,p
"great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .",p
i am bored with the silver look .,n
it has a nice color screen .,p
it is small .,p
"radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .",p
t-mobile was a pretty good server .,p
they are not wowable good .,n
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !,n
"this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .",n
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .,n
"when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :",n
"while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .",p
"negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .",n
poor visibility on the keys .,p
"the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...",p
only con i can think of is no camera ... .,n
this phone is a winner ...,p
"anything this phone does , it does perfectly .",p
"the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .",p
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .,p
as said before this works perfectly .,p
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .,p
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .,p
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .,p
"only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .",n
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .,p
"this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .",p
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .,p
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .,n
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .,p
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .,p
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .,p
"when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .",p
"this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .",p
the battery life on this phone is surreal .,p
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .,p
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .,p
"this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .",p
"bluetooth[-1],high speed internet[-1]##the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .",n
"overall , i highly recommend this phone .",p
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .,p
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .,p
"sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .",p
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .,p
"surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .",p
"ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .",n
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .,n
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .,n
nice little phone ... light compact . .,n
buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..,n
"although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .",p
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .,p
i like the size and weight of this little critter .,p
"i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .",p
"the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .",n
"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .",n
"the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .",p
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .,p
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .,n
"the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .",n
the vibrate setting is loud !,n
"so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .",n
"but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .",p
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .,n
" light , compact design",p
"solid , high-quality construction",p
 well-backlit keypad,p
outstanding signal reception,p
excellent sound quality,p
" bright , visible screen",p
 speakerphone,p
 very long-lasting battery life,p
some features in the user interface,n
 no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking,n
 no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .,n
no propietary headset jack,n
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .,p
i like the speakphone function a lot .,p
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .,p
i like the automatic key lock function .,p
the phone is very light weight .,p
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .,p
the fm radio is cool .,p
"while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .",p
and really this is the best phone one could have .,p
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .,p
"it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .",p
"this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .",p
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .,p
"its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .",p
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .,p
only if we could get one camera in it . .,n
i am enjoying my phone a lot ....,p
small size .,p
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .,p
color screen is good .,p
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .,p
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .,p
"navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .",p
"battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .",p
"the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .",n
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?,n
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .,p
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .,p
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .,p
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .,n
"it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .",n
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .,n
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .,p
this is the best phone i have seen .,p
the phones are awesome .,p
"we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .",p
"you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .",p
"the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .",p
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .,p
"nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com",p
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .,p
the features are really cool like the radio .,p
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .,p
"technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !",p
"i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .",p
"for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .",p
"this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !",p
"this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .",p
its quiet .,p
"nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .",p
"first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .",p
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .,p
"the phone is small , light , and very attractive .",p
the battery life is amazing .,p
"the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .",p
"i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .",p
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .,p
"i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .",n
"it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .",p
"this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .",p
"the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .",p
i simply love this feature .,p
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .,p
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .,p
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .,p
"additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )",p
"the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .",p
"the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .",p
"i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .",p
"not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .",p
"in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .",p
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .,p
"even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .",p
"although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .",n
"the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .",n
"however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .",p
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .,n
"one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .",n
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .,p
nokia does not disappoint in this model .,p
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !,n
"it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .",p
great phone .. .,p
great features .. .,p
"i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .",p
i have had no problems with the phone .,p
"great phone , i 'd buy another .",p
"excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .",p
"one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .",n
overall an excellent phone .,p
the service from t-mobile is very good too .,p
"great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !",p
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .,p
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .,p
"service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .",p
"this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .",p
"1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .",p
"yes , the features are numerous .",p
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .,p
"the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .",p
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .,p
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .,p
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .,p
the radio feature has superb sound quality .,p
it has a classic design yet looks hip .,p
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .,p
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .,p
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .,n
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .,n
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .,n
battery life is good for a phone of this size .,p
"but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .",p
great screen and great sound .,p
"the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .",p
"the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .",p
"the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .",p
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .,p
"this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .",n
"other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .",p
"finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .",n
"their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .",n
"the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .",p
"after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .",p
"it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .",p
"unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .",n
"when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .",p
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !,p
"the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?",p
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .,p
"the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .",p
"the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .",p
"one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .",n
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .,p
"the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .",p
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .,p
"nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .",p
"with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .",p
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .,n
"the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .",n
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .,p
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .,p
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .,p
"however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .",n
when talking the voice is not very clear .,n
"but , i would definately recommend this phone .",p
it is crystal clear .,p
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .,p
