canon powershot g3[+3]##i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .,p
"use[+2]##the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .",p
picture[+2]##they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .,p
picture quality[+1]##a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .,p
picture quality[+1]##i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .,p
"camera[+2], use[+2], feature[+1]##bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .",p
"picture quality[+3], use[+1], option[+1]##i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .",p
"camera[+2]##this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !",p
"picture[+2]##just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .",p
"use[+1]##whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .",p
dial[-1]##* main dial is not backlit .,n
viewfinder[-2]##* lens visible in optical viewfinder .,n
camera[+2][p]##overall i 'm happy with my toy .,p
"camera[+3]##in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera .",p
"speed[+2],picture quality[+2],function[+2]##i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .",p
"auto setting[+2]##with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .",p
"camera[+3]##i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .",p
canon g3[+3]##i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .,p
photo quality[+2]##i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .,p
"feature[+2]##the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .",p
"viewfinder[-1]##the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .",n
"camera[+2]##despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .",p
camera[+2]##i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .,p
photo quality[+3]##the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .,p
"darn diopter adjustment dial[-1]##the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )",n
"exposure control[+2],auto setting[+2]##1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .",p
metering option[+2]##excellent range of metering options as well .,p
spot metering[+1]##it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .,p
4mp[+1]##2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ),p
zoom[+1]##3 ) 4x zoom is nice,p
focus[+2]##5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .,p
"focus[+2]##you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .",p
"size[-2][u],weight[-2][u]##1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )",n
design[-2][u]##2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ),n
viewfinder[-2]##4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .,n
"feature[+2], ##the camera has a wonderful set of features .",p
lcd[+2]##the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .,p
"optical zoom[+2],digital zoom[+1]##the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .",p
picture[+3]##the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .,p
"picture[+3]##i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .",p
"software[+2]##the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .",p
"lens cap[-1],viewfinder[-1]##the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .",n
"menu[+1],button[+1]##the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .",p
camera[+3]##it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .,p
camera[+3]##recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .,p
control[+2]##advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .,p
auto setting[+2]##newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .,p
photo quality[+3]##4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .,p
use[+2][u]##those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .,p
"zoom[+2],lense[+2]##the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .",p
camera[+3]##i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !,p
"picture[+3], control[+2], battery[+2], software[+2]##it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .",p
"photo quality[+2], auto mode[+2]##i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .",p
"canera[+2]##this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .",p
print[+2]##the prints are beautiful !,p
"battery[+1]##although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .",p
camera[+2]##this is a great camera for you !,p
"control[+2],auto mode[+2]##the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .",p
"control[+2]##i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .",p
"photo[+3]##i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .",p
"control[+2]##but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !",p
"dial[+1]##with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .",p
manual mode[+2]##the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .,p
"feel[+2],weight[+2]##this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .",p
"feel[+2]##you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .",p
"camera[+2][p]##the more i work with it , the more i love it !",p
camera[+3][u]##i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !,p
"camera[+3]##this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .",p
"camera[+2][u]##seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .",p
"picture[+2], auto mode[+2]##but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !",p
four megapixel[+1]##four megapixels is great .,p
product[+3][u]##it is a very amazing product .,p
camera[+3][p]##i highly recommend it .,p
feature[+2]##just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .,p
photo[+2]##takes excellent photos .,p
night mode[+2]##night mode is clear as day .,p
"use[+1][u]##i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .",p
viewfinder[-1]##the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .,n
camera[+3]##overall it is the best camera on the market .,p
"picture quality[+3]##a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )",p
"lens cover[-2]##b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .",n
"zooming lever[-2]##the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .",n
camera[+2]##i love this camera .,p
picture[+2]##took hundreds of pictures and they were great .,p
"color[+2],picture[+2],white balance[+2]##great colors , pictures and white balance .",p
optical zoom[+1]##has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .,p
"picture[-3][u]##maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .",n
price[-3][u]##it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .,n
"camera[-2][u]##sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .",n
camera[-3]##i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .,n
grain[-3]##the grain was terrible .,n
"flash photo[-3],noise[-2]##well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .",n
"photo[+3]##when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .",p
camera[+1]##the camera was a marvel .,p
camera[+3][p]##it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .,p
"g3[+1]##i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .",p
"lag time[-2],flash[-2]##the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .",n
depth[+1]##what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .,p
"flash[-2]##relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .",n
"external flash hot shoe[+1]##fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .",p
"flash[+2]##contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .",p
"software[-2]##now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !",n
"software[-2]##the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .",n
g3[+3]##what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .,p
"color[+3]##without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !",p 
"g3[+3],software[-2]##the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .",p
software[-2]##what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .,n
image[+3]##but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .,p
"raw image[+3]##i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .",p
"camera[+2][p]##i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .",p
camera[+3]##this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .,p
"battery life[+1]##battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .",p
"manual function[+2],picture quality[+3]##manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .",p
"viewfinder[-1],lcd[+2],camera[+3]##not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .",p
service[+3]##the service from the supplier was exceptional .,p
"photo[+3]##having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .",p
"photo[+3]##by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .",p
"automode[+2],manual mode[+2]##the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .",p
viewfinder[-2]##about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .,n
camera[+3]##i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !,p
canon[+3]##but canon never fails to amaze .,p
raw format[+2]##1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .,p
"battery life[+1]##2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .",p
software[+2]##3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .,p
"shape[+1]##4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .",p
light auto correction[+2]##the light auto-correction is awesome .,p
picture[+2]##you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .,p
"white offset[+2]##8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .",p
"g3[+3]##overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .",p
camera[+3][p]##this is quite simply the best you can ask for .,p
low light focus[-2]##the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .,n
picture[-3]##got way too many blurry pictures .,n
"photo[+3], use[+3], software[+2]##4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )",p
camera[+2]##the powershot g3 is a great camera .,p
photo[+3]##because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !,p
"camera[+2]##4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .",p
feature[+1]##it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .,p
"unresponsiveness[-2]##the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .",n
delay[-1][u]##it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .,n
delay[-2][u]##canon 's g3 does it consistently .,n
"focus[-2], shoot[-2]##it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .",n
"g3[-2]##unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .",n
camera[+3]##this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .,p
picture quality[+2]##i love the quality of the pictures .,p
picture quality[+2][p]##they look fantastic .,p
4mp camera[+2]##the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .,p
"picture[+2]##with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .",p
"control[+2],menu[+2]##i love the eos based controls and easy menus .",p
lens cap[-2]##1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .,n
"body[-2]##2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .",n
casing[-2]##it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .,n
"performance[+3][p]##i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !",p
"camera[+3]##this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !",p
battery life[+3]##another point of note : the battery life is incredible !,p
camera[+2]##am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !,p
"camera[+2]##i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .",p
menu[+2]##very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .,p
battery[+2]##the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .,p
"optical zoom[+3],viewfinder[+1]##the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .",p
"viewfinder[-2]##one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .",n
camera[+3]##the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .,p
camera[+3]##because this camera is beautiful .,p
look[+3]##the g3 looks like a work of art !,p
"finish[+3]##its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .",p
camera[+2][p]##i am very pleased with it so far .,p
viewfinder[-2]##you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .,n
"tiff format[-2]##( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .",n
lag[-2]##it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?,n
import[+2]##it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .,p
camera[+2]##i am quite happy with the camera .,p
manual[+2]##it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .,p
"camera[+2][p]##yes , i recommend it over the competition .",p
"camera[+3]##best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .",p
"stitch picture[+2]##this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .",p
"picture[+2]##first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .",p
camera[+2]##this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .,p
"camera[+3]##however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .",p
"design[+2], feature[+2],use[+1][u],battery[+2]##it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !",p
"display[+2]##also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .",p
"compactflash[-2]##one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .",n
noise[+2]##another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .,p
camera[+2]##i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .,p
camera[+2]##it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..,p
"use[+1][u],design[+1][u]##in general it is easy to use and well laid out .",p
"use[+3],control[+2]##it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .",p
feature[+2]##the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .,p
"auto mode[+1]##in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .",p
memory card[-2]##the included memory card is too small .,n
made[-2]##it is made of plastic .,n
lens[-1]##the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .,n
"size[-1][u]##while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .",n
lever[-1]##the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .,n
"flash[-1]##flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .",n
strap[-2]##the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .,n
camera[+2]##the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .,p
"option[+1}, control[+1]##canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .",p
learning[+1]##learning how to use it will not take very long .,p
image quality[+3]##the image quality is excellent .,p
function[+1]##range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .,p
camera[+2]##this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .,p
"macro[+2], auto mode[+2]##the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .",p
camera[+2]##this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .,p
4mp resolution[+1]##i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;,p
"distortion[-1][u]##yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .",n
"shot[+2]##in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !",p
"picture[+3],learning curve[+1]##the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .",p
"picture quality[+2]##i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .",p
camera[+2]##the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .,p
"picture[+2],feel[+1][u]##it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .",p
"viewfinder[-2]##to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .",n
design[-3]##this camera has a major design flaw .,n
viewfinder[-2]##when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .,n
camera[+2]##everything else about the camera is great .,p
"camera[+2]##if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .",p
"camera[+3][u]##and so far , i 've been very pleased .",p
"lens[+2],optical zoom[+1]##the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .",p
lcd[+2]##the moveable lcd screen is great .,p
"remote[+2]##the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .",p
hot shoe flash[+1]##the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :,p
"battery[+2]##i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :",p
"battery charging system[+1]##the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .",p
"manual[+1]##i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .",p
"highlight[-1]##i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .",n
"no-off button[-2]##the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .",n
"body[-2]##and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .",n
"download[+1]##i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .",p
camera[+3]##i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .,p
"camera[+3],use[+1],photo[+3]##very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .",p
g3[+2]##i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .,p
"camera[+3]##all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .",p
optic[+2]##canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .,p
"digital camera[+3]##simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .",p
battery life[+2]##the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .,p
"look[-2]##the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .",n
"camera[+3]##even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .",p
camera[+3]##definetely a great camera .,p
"quality[+2],lens[+2]##proven canon built quality and lens .",p
feel[+2]##feels solid in hand .,p
"weight[-1],camera[+2]##rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .",n
